        <h1>Patient: Edward Nigma</h1>

       <p>Dr. Young: Taped interview 39. Patient's name is Edward Nigma. At this point in
time I have yet to decide if Mr. Nigma is a suitable candidate for the Titan
process.  I'd like to talk about your childhood.</p>

<p>Edward: Miserable. Next?</p>

<p>Doctor: By all accounts that is where your fascination with riddles began. I
believe discussing those years could explain your compulsive behavior.</p>

<p>Edward: Very well... (Sigh) My father hated me. Always called me a moron.</p>

<p>Doctor: I see.</p>

<p>Edward: I was determined to prove him wrong, so I entered a contest at school.
A twenty dollar prize to the kid who could figure out an almost impossible logic
problem. I won, of course.</p>

<p>Doctor: And that pleased your father?</p>

<p>Edward: Hardly. He was convinced I had cheated. He kept yelling, "You must have
cheated! Admit it, you moron! You cheated!" I swore I didn't and he beat me for
lying.</p>

<p>Doctor: Iâ€™m sorry to hear that, Edward.</p>

<p>Edward: Don't be. He was right.</p>
