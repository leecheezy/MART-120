        <h1>Short Story</h1>
        
       <p>I heard joke once: </p>
       <p></p>
        <p>Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Life seems harsh, and cruel. Says he feels all alone in threatening world.</p> 
        <p>Doctor says: "Treatment is simple. The great clown - Pagliacci - is in town. Go see him. That should pick you up." </p>
        <p>Man bursts into tears. "But doctor..." he says "I am Pagliacci." </p>
        <p>Good joke. </p>
        <p>Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains.</p>
